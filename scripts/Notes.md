# NOTES

## EagleEye Players

   - Targets are identified by looking at targets with goggles/helmet equipped.
   - All allied EagleEye players share complete visibility of each otherâ€™s bounding boxes and skeletons.
   - Targets identified by one EagleEye player, including drones, are automatically synchronized with all other EagleEye players.
   - Enemy skeletons are only visible when an EagleEye player has a direct line of sight to the target.
   - EagleEye players can mark targets via ACE Pointing (Shift + `) at the tracked target.
   - Marked targets will incrementally update ID.

## Performance

   - Rendering many targets may significantly impact frame rates.
   - The system is optimized for small teams and has not been extensively tested in large-scale scenarios.

   ## Functions

   - To force add EagleEye to AI (Not requied for players)
   - [_myUnit] call XK_6DOF_fnc_add6dof;

   - To force add EagleEye to drone (designed for AR-2 Darters, other drones may not work as intended)
   - [_myDrone] call XK_6DOF_fnc_add6dofDrone;

   - Manually mark a unit to EagleEye users
   - ["XK_6DOF_EH_targetIncr", _myUnit] call CBA_fnc_serverEvent;

   ## Variables

   - _name <STRING> - Name to display on nametags, intended for non-EagleEye users.
   - _target setVariable ["XK_6DOF_Name", _name];

   
# Known Limitations

   - Overlay loses IFF colors under NVGs. This is due to drawLine3D being rendered in world space, the IFF markers above the head are a work around to this problem.
   - Overlays cannot be seen inside vehicles. Vehicle interiors are rendered in front of the world space, same as above.
   - Bad performance with lots of units. Draw3D has to be run on every frame, I've tried to optimise it where possible. This was designed around milsim groups with less target saturation.
