## NOTES

## EagleEye Players

   - All allied EagleEye players share complete visibility of each otherâ€™s bounding boxes and skeletons.
   - Targets identified by one EagleEye player, including drones, are automatically synchronized with all other EagleEye players.
   - Enemy skeletons are only visible when an EagleEye player has a direct line of sight to the target.

## Performance

   - Rendering many targets (25 or more) may significantly impact frame rates.
   - The system is optimized for small teams and has not been extensively tested in large-scale scenarios.
